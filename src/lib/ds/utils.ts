/**
 * tailwind-merge configured with the Dropout custom type scale.
 *
 * Without this, twMerge can't tell `text-micro`/`text-subtitle`/… are font
 * *sizes* — they aren't t-shirt sizes or arbitrary lengths, so they fall through
 * to the catch-all `text-{color}` group. The result: any class list that merges a
 * custom size with a color (e.g. an `Eyebrow`'s `text-micro` + `text-ink-muted`)
 * silently drops the size and the element falls back to the inherited font size.
 *
 * Registering the scale's literals under `font-size` makes them win over the
 * color validator (a literal class part outranks a validator in the class map),
 * so size and color coexist. Keep this list in sync with the `--text-*` tokens in
 * `tokens.css`.
